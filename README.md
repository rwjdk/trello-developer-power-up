The API Developer ID Helper Power-Up allows Trello API Developers easy access to the technical IDs of a Trello Board (Board ID, List ID, and Card ID), instead of the rather cumbersome "[Export to JSON](https://youtu.be/aWYEg1wPVYY)" method.

## Copy Card Data
Get CardId and the other various IDs on a card (ListId, CardId, Member IDs, Label Ids and Checklist Ids), or the entire Card JSON directly from the Card-Button in your clipboard

## Copy List Data
Get ListId or the List with Card JSON from the List "..." dropdown menu in your clipboard

## Copy Board Data
Get BoardId, the Board as JSON, WorkSpace ID, the Member Ids and Label Ids from the Board-Button to your your clipboard

## Settings
By default, the Info buttons are shown to all users, but if you like you can hide them for all users and then personally override that the buttons should be shown to you only:
